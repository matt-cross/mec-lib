MEC Lib
=======

This is Matt Cross's library of useful C utilities.  They are mostly
flexible data structures, along with test utilities used for
development and validation.  They are mostly generic C code and are
intended to be able to work in embedded or kernel space as well as
application space.

I'm publishing them here for my own reference.  If you find them
useful, that's great.
